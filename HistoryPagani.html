        <h2>The boy who wanted to create the most beautiful car in the world.</h2>
    </div>
    <p>The “piecita”, or the “closet” in his native town in Argentina, is the room where the young creator would disappear to work with balsa wood, drawing and carving those little models that would one day turn to his eyes as the most beautiful cars in the world. That was in Casilda, where, on the 10th of November 1955, Horacio Pagani was born.</p>
    <p>As a child, Horacio used to spend his time at the shop of Tito Ispani, a local modeler working on naval and aeronautical projects, trying to learn all the secrets regarding the finishing techniques of the fragile wood and on the mistery of his perfect Duco paint.</p>
    <p>Today some of those models that survived the ravages of time and the indifference of many who were at that time unable to appreciate them properly, are exhibited in the new museum of Via Dell’Industria 26, in San Cesario sul Panaro, Modena.</p>
